# The Gabmeister Resources
This page is a collection of links that have helped me throughout my career as a VR, AR, Unreal Engine, and Unity Developer. I’m constantly updating this list, removing old items and adding new ones. I try to remove those that are older than 5 years old. However, there are exceptions which I truly believe contain information that are relevant today. I hope that these resources assist you in your journey.

Function can return value(s). Event cannot have any output. Event can use Delay node or timelines, functions cannot. Functions are guaranteed to execute and return immediately by limiting what kinds of nodes can be placed in a function (latent actions, timelines, etc… are all prohibited). Function can use local variables(s).
- [Interfaces vs Casting performance](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/ActorCommunication/InterfaceQuickStart/). "There are also performance benefits when Interfaces over casting, as loading an Actor that casts to another Actor will subsequently load that Actor to memory as well. If not treated carefully, this could result in a cascading loading effect where loading a single Actor results in several other Actors being loaded into memory as well."

###Polycount Wiki
The [Polycount Wiki](http://wiki.polycount.com/wiki/Polycount) is "a catalog of information aimed at game development artists; whether professional, student, or hobbyist." To be honest, this is the only resource you need if you're starting out as a 3D Game Artist. It covers all the topics. Don't be fooled by the old-school UI. This is the place where the AAA game artists hang-out. I'll try and hand-pick a couple of links which are pertinent to 3D environment art:
