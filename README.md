# The Gabmeister Resources
This page is a collection of links I have found useful throughout my career (mostly Unity, Unreal, VR, and AR). I’m constantly updating this list, removing old items and adding new ones. I try to remove those that are older than 5 years old. However, there are exceptions which I truly believe contain information that are relevant today. 

One major shift that happened recently was the advent of AI. Large language models (LLMs) made a lot of beginner-level resources obsolete. We used to scavange the depths of online forums and stack overflow looking for "how-to" tutorials. Nowadays, we ask AI first, and do a search only if the answer is inadequate. This is why I will focus on resources that I think add value on top of what AI can already provide. 

The two biggest mistakes I did back when I was starting was getting into game engines and going straight into object-oriented programming (OOP) without understanding the fundamentals. I have never taken any formal computer science or game development education, so I just jumped straight into Unity and watched YouTube tutorials. Mainstream game engines do a lot of heavy lifting to abstract away the complexity happening under the hood. If you stay too long working on this abstraction layer, your knowledge and skills will plateau early, and it will be harder to tackle complex projects that require deeper understanding. That is why I recommend studying Assembly, C, C++, and non-OOP paradigms alongside learning game engines. If you have lots of time, I recommend making your own simple game engine just for learning. Get comfortable programming like how it was in the 90s, and gradually move up the abstraction layers.

Another best practice, if it's not already obvious, is to read the manual. The Unity and Unreal documentation, for example, are continously being updated. You would be surprised how much hidden gems are tucked away here.

These will allow the Crash Reporter to show you a detailed call stack. Moreover, the Crash Reporter does not show up when you're using a UE5 Editor Source Build from GitHub. Instead, you need to run Debug Mode in Visual Studio.

###Polycount Wiki
The [Polycount Wiki](http://wiki.polycount.com/wiki/Polycount) is "a catalog of information aimed at game development artists; whether professional, student, or hobbyist." To be honest, this is the only resource you need if you're starting out as a 3D Game Artist. It covers all the topics. Don't be fooled by the old-school UI. This is the place where the AAA game artists hang-out. I'll try and hand-pick a couple of links which are pertinent to 3D environment art:
