# The Gabmeister Resources
This page is a collection of links that have helped me throughout my career as a VR, AR, Unreal Engine, and Unity Developer. Iâ€™m constantly updating this list, removing old items and adding new ones. I try to remove those that are older than 5 years old. However, there are exceptions which I truly believe contain information that are relevant today. I hope that these resources assist you in your journey.
