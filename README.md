# The Gabmeister Resources
This page is a collection of links that have helped me throughout my career as a VR, AR, Unreal Engine, and Unity Developer. I’m constantly updating this list, removing old items and adding new ones. I try to remove those that are older than 5 years old. However, there are exceptions which I truly believe contain information that are relevant today. I hope that these resources assist you in your journey.

## 3D Environment Art

###Polycount Wiki
The Polycount Wiki is “a catalog of information aimed at game development artists; whether professional, student, or hobbyist.” To be honest, this is the only resource you need if you’re starting out as a 3D Game Artist. It covers all the topics. Don’t be fooled by the old-school UI. This is the place where the AAA game artists hang-out. I’ll try and hand-pick a couple of links which are pertinent to 3D environment art:
